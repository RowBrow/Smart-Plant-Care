# Problem Field
With the increasing use of sensor technologies and microcontrollers in various applications, there is a need to develop software that can create an effective interaction between these technologies. Without such integration, data collection and analysis can become fragmented and inefficient, hindering the ability to make informed decisions in real time.

This project addresses this challenge by developing a software solution that can work with sensors and microcontrollers to collect and analyze data in real time. However, we will focus solely on the software/program aspect, as we may not have sufficient time to fully integrate all sensors and microcontrollers with the software.

By focusing on identifying and selecting appropriate sensor technologies, developing software for data collection and analysis, implementing reliable communication protocols, and creating a user-friendly interface, the project aims to improve the performance and efficiency of the system. Extensive testing will ensure that the system functions correctly and meets the requirements. The software must be easy and intuitive to use, ensuring that users can interact with and benefit from the system without extensive training.

# Problem Statement
How can we develop a Java-based software program that effectively interacts with sensors and microcontrollers to collect and analyze data in real time while ensuring that the program is user-friendly and intuitive to use?

# Project Delimitation
We will focus on software development and avoid full integration of the hardware components, as the time frame does not allow for complete implementation.

# Project Goals
The aim of this project is to gain a deep understanding of plant well-being and needs and to develop a semi-automatic system that can supply the plants and reduce maintenance time.

We intend to create a computer science project focused on designing a Java-based software program. This program will utilize data-driven decisions based on input from sensors and possibly cameras.

Our objective is to enable the program to optimize plant growth while minimizing resource consumption during the learning process. We plan to use the LILYGO® T-Higrow ESP32 board as our primary sensor for monitoring.
